#+title: why ADCS is Critical
#+Author:gabriel

* intro
*Authentication* -->
- strong authentication for users, computers, and services (ex: smart card logon, VPN, Wi-Fi)

*Secure communication* -->
- SSL/TLS for web servers, IPSec

*Digital Signing* -->
- code signing, document signing

*High Trust Level* -->
- certificates issued by ADCS are inherently trusted by the domain

* common attack vectors & mis-configs
excessive permissions over certificate template, certification theft or impersonation are common attack vectors

| esc ID | misconfiguration | permissions | attack scenario (impact)
| esc1 | a certificate template lets regular users requests certificates and lets them put 'any' name they want (like Administrator) in the certificate | ENROLL | 1. low priv user -> request cert (with privileged UPN in SAN) 2. CA issues cert 3. Authenticate as privileged user |
